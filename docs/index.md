# Rotary

## Preface

I got an old rotary phone from my grand aunt which I used just as a normal telephone,
as my parents telephone system supports pulse dialing.

As I moved out for studying, I did not use it anymore and it just lay dormant back in my room.
Some day, I got the idea how awesome it would be to transform it into a mobile phone.
After some poking on the internet, I found someone had build something similar, simulating button presses on a regular mobile phone by shorting out the keyboard contacts with MOSFETs and a microcontroller.

I just had to try it, so I ordered the parts neccessary and started building.
The phone worked, but there were some issues. Especially, I had no feedback from the phone and it could get stuck in some menu.

The Phone once again lay around, not being used until one day the Adafruit Feather FONA caught my eye.
This was the solution to all my problems (as it turned out, it caused a few new problems), as it integrated a microcontroller with a GSM modem and battery charging circuitry on a neat little board.
